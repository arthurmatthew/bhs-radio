	<p class="max-w-screen-xl text-xl md:text-3xl">
		This website is currently under construction. In the future, you will be able to stream our
		radio station from this website. Our club meets on Wednesdays after school in the band room.
		Check out our Instagram <b class="text-red-700">@bhs_radio_club</b> to see any updates about canceled
		meetings! We're currently in the setup phase, so it's possible that you won't have much to do, but
		on the contrary you could end up helping us out a lot! We envision that club members will be able
		to curate and design their own radio shows, help with creative (sound & art, etc.) design, and help
		with software development.
